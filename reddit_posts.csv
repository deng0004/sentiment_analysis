[Source: Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc>). The charges include: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Conspiracy Against Rights. [You can read the full indictment for yourself here at CourtListener.](<https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_1.pdf>) These charges stem from one of two separate investigations into Trump being conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for the US Department of Justice. The first investigation is into the apparent mishandling of highly classified documents after Trump had departed office. This resulted in [37 felony charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/06/09/1181340894/trump-indictment-classified-documents-charges>) being made public on June 9th of this year, with [3 additional, related charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190953438/trump-faces-new-charges-in-classified-documents-case>) added last week. Today's charges stem from the second investigation headed by Smith, which is into the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol and associated efforts within the Trump Administration to illegally overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The aforementioned investigations into Trump are a separate matter from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's inquiry, which in April resulted in an indictment on [34 counts of falsification of business records](<https://www.npr.org/2023/04/04/1167708172/trump-charges-hush-money-new-york-indictment>). According to Bragg, Trump was part of a scheme to catch and kill"" negative information about himself before and after the 2016 election via hush money payments made via the Trump Organization.  Still outstanding are the results of a fourth probe being conducted by Fani Willis, the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia.  That probe is into Trump and others' efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results; an announcement related to DA Willis' probe is [expected sometime later in August](https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-election-investigation-fani-willis-d6191037a8993d653686e679bf5e8ea5).

1660003796.0,Megathread: FBI Searches Former President Donald Trump's Florida Home,"Former President Donald J. Trump said on Monday that the F.B.I. had searched his Palm Beach, Fla., home and had broken open a safe — an account that, if accurate, would be a dramatic escalation in the various investigations into the former president. The search, according to two people familiar with the investigation, appeared to be focused on material that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, after he left the White House. Those boxes contained many pages of classified documents, according to a person familiar with their contents. The discovery of classified information at Mar-a-Lago was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it had found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

1656080661.0,Megathread: Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade,"The Supreme Court has officially released its ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, on the constitutionality of pre-viability abortion bans. The Court ruled 6–3 that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, overturning both Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and returning ""the authority to regulate abortion"" to the states.

Justice Alito delivered the majority opinion, joined by Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Justices Thomas, Kavanaugh, and Chief Justice Roberts each filed concurring opinions, while Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan dissented.

Not a anarchy argument for eliminated government.
If you think you want evidence, turn on the TV.

I’d like to see some conversation about the structure of government some investigation into a system that seems to have served so well is the past but year by year seems to be failing.

The structure of government and political machine we have developed in the US, the party system, the electoral system, the media, the money, its simply broken. A system design to represent the people has been hijacked by money and power. The interests of the citizen are no longer aligned with the interested of the corporations. The defense of the people is not a realistic problem in a globalized culture, defense of the corporations; economic interests and the military industrial complex are the real military priority. The rotating door policy between government and high paying corporate jobs eliminates any clear difference between private and public sectors. The political grandstanding, it’s a farce, a distraction from the very broken government, draining its citizens of money, intelligence, political power and respect.

This is not representative government, they are not representing my interests and they are not representing yours. Stop defending them, and start defending yourself."

1628007802.0,"Megathread: New York AG Says Gov. Cuomo Sexually Harassed Multiple Women, Broke Laws","Today, New York Attorney General Letitia James released the [results of the independent investigation](<https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/independent-investigators-find-governor-cuomo-sexually-harassed-multiple-women>) into the sexual harassment allegations against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. In the report, independent investigators found that Governor Cuomo’s actions ""violated multiple state and federal laws, as well as the Executive Chamber’s own written policies"".

Sexual harassment allegations against Governor Cuomo first surfaced in December of 2020, leading to calls for his resignation and for a large number of calls for impeachment by the New York State Legislature. In late February, Attorney General James appointed an independent panel to investigate the allegations, and the legislature authorized an impeachment investigation in March.

1607466405.0,Megathread: U.S. Supreme Court Rejects Republican Challenge to Biden's Pennsylvania Win,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday handed a defeat to Republicans seeking to throw out up to 2.5 million mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania as they try to undo President Donald Trump’s election loss, with the justices refusing to block the state from formalizing President-elect Joe Biden’s victory there.

The court in a brief order rejected a request made by U.S. Congressman Mike Kelly, a Trump ally, and other Pennsylvania Republicans who filed a lawsuit after the Nov. 3 election arguing that the state’s 2019 expansion of mail-in voting was illegal under state law.

Reuters reported last week that Krebs, who worked on protecting the election from hackers but drew the ire of the Trump White House over efforts to debunk disinformation, had told associates he expected to be fired.

Krebs headed up the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

CISA Deputy Secretary Matthew Travis has now resigned, according to Reuters. Sources at the time of this edit have not fully confirmed if the resignation was voluntary or forced.

1597763545.0,Megathread: Senate Intel Committee Releases Final Report Detailing Ties Between 2016 Trump Campaign and Russian Interference,"A sprawling report released Tuesday by a Republican-controlled Senate panel that spent three years investigating Russia’s 2016 election interference laid out an extensive web of contacts between Trump campaign advisers and Russian government officials and other Russians, including some with ties to the country’s intelligence services.

The report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, totaling nearly 1,000 pages, provided a bipartisan Senate imprimatur for an extraordinary set of facts: The Russian government undertook an extensive campaign to try to sabotage the 2016 American election to help Mr. Trump become president, and some members of Mr. Trump’s circle of advisers were open to the help from an American adversary.

1608686039.0,"Megathread: President Trump Pardons 15, Including GOP Allies, a 2016 Campaign Official Ensnared in the Russia Probe, and Government Contractors Convicted in an Iraq Massacre","In a pre-Christmas round of pardons, President Trump granted clemency on Tuesday to two people convicted in the special counsel’s Russia inquiry, four Blackwater guards convicted in connection with the killing of Iraqi civilians, and three former Republican members of Congress convicted of corruption.

Among those pardoned was George Papadopoulos, who was a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign and pleaded guilty in 2017 to making false statements to federal officials as part of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.

Also pardoned was Alex van der Zwaan, a lawyer who pleaded guilty to the same charge in 2018 in connection with the special counsel’s inquiry. Both men served short prison sentences.

1586282034.0,Megathread: President Donald Trump Removes Watchdog Overseeing Rollout of $2 Trillion Coronavirus Bill,"President Trump on Monday replaced the Pentagon's acting Inspector General Glenn Fine, who had been selected to chair the panel overseeing the rollout of the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed last month, Politico first reported.

 A group of independent federal watchdogs selected Fine to lead the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, but Fine's removal from his Pentagon job prevents him from being able to serve in that position — since the law only allows sitting inspectors general to fill the role.

1590701977.0,Megathread: President Donald Trump signs executive order targeting protections for social media platforms,"President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday designed to limit the legal protections that shield social media companies from liability for the content users post on their platforms.

""Currently, social media giants like Twitter receive an unprecedented liability shield based on the theory that they are a neutral platform, which they are not,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""We are fed up with it. It is unfair, and it's been very unfair.""

The order comes after the president escalated his attacks against Big Tech in recent days — specifically Twitter, which fact-checked him for the first time this week over an unsubstantiated claim that mail-in voting drives voter fraud.

The President has narrow, limited authority to withhold appropriations under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. OMB told GAO that it withheld the funds to ensure that they were not spent ""in a manner that could conflict with the President’s foreign policy."" The law does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons.

1580087891.0,Megathread: Fmr. National Security Advisor John Bolton Alleges President Trump Tied Ukraine Funding to Investigation Into Bidens,"President Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton alleges in his forthcoming book that the president explicitly told him ""he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including the Bidens,"" the New York Times first reported.

The revelations present a dramatic 11th hour turn in Trump’s Senate impeachment trial. They directly contradict Trump’s claim that he never tied the hold-up of Ukrainian aid to his demands for investigations into his political opponent Joe Biden.

1563120674.0,Megathread: Trump Tells Freshman Congresswomen to 'Go Back' to the Countries They Came From,"President Trump on Sunday lashed out at a group of progressive Democrats, saying the female lawmakers should ''go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came'' before criticizing policies in the U.S.

''So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run,'' Trump said in an early morning string of tweets.

The justices’ 6-3 decision follows a series of recent mass shootings and is expected to ultimately allow more people to legally carry guns on the streets of the nation’s largest cities — including New York, Los Angeles and Boston — and elsewhere. About a quarter of the U.S. population lives in states expected to be affected by the ruling, the high court’s first major gun decision in more than a decade.

1536941436.0,Megathread: Trump ex-campaign chief Manafort to help Russia inquiry in plea deal,"Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has agreed to co-operate with an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election as part of a plea deal.

In court on Friday, he pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in the deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

The agreement avoids a second trial on money laundering and other charges.

Manafort was convicted last month on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose banks accounts.

It was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

However, the charges only relate to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign.

On Friday, he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice.

1642107967.0,"Megathread: Supreme Court halts vaccine mandate for large businesses, leaves mandate for healthcare workers in place","The Supreme Court has blocked a key plank of the Biden administration's pandemic response effort, by halting enforcement of the OSHA vaccine mandate. In a 6-3 ruling, the Court judged that requiring employees at large businesses to be vaccinated against COVID, or undergo weekly testing and wear a mask, exceeded the authority granted by Congress.  All three liberal justices dissented.

At the same time, in a second unsigned opinion, Court has allowed the administration to continue enforcement of a vaccinate mandate for healthcare workers at facilities that receive Medicaid or Medicare funding. This measure is expected to affect 10 million workers and takes effect this month. Conservative justices Thomas, Aliton, Gorsuch, and Barrett dissented, while Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh sided with their liberal collogues.

1517592183.0,Megathread: White House releases controversial memo on allegations of intelligence abuse,">(AP) — The White House on Friday declassified a partisan and bitterly disputed memo on the Russia investigation, clearing the way for House Republicans to release allegations of what they say is FBI misconduct.

>The move came over the fierce objections of the FBI and Justice Department, which have said the document prepared by Republicans on the House intelligence committee is inaccurate and missing critical context.

>The memo alleges that the FBI abused U.S. government surveillance powers in its investigation into Russian election interference. Trump, who has called the investigation a “witch hunt,” has supported the release of the memo in the apparent hopes that it could help undermine the probe being led by special counsel Robert Mueller.

This is a megathread to discuss the authorization and impending release of the House Intelligence Committees memo authored by Rep. Nunes (R-CA). **Please note that off topic and low effort comments may be automatically removed**

Trump made the announcement to reporters Friday on Air Force One as he returned from Florida.

""As far as TikTok is concerned, we’re banning them from the United States,"" Trump said.

U.S. lawmakers have raised intelligence and privacy concerns about the company’s ownership. The company has denied allegations that it shares user data with the Chinese government.

The move comes as Trump has ratcheted up tensions with China during the coronavirus pandemic and stalled trade negotiations between the two nations.

The company’s operations in the U.S. has been under review by the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

Trump said he could use emergency economic powers or an executive order to enforce the action, insisting, ""I have that authority.""

1451191349.0,"As a Canadian living in America, mark my words - any candidate who is not in favor of a single payer health care system does not have best interests of the American people at the top of his or her list of priorities.","I absolutely promise you that if you were forced to live under a single-payer system for a few years and were forced to return to America's current system, you'd riot in the streets. The current health care system benefits only the most avaricious players in that system and those who collude with such players. As American people, you should expect no less from your representatives than for them to acknowledge that our current system is sick and abusive. It is one of the biggest pieces of the cogwork of systemic poverty, and works to keep people mired in poverty, debt, and bankruptcy in a way that is a crude mockery of the American dream. 

The fact that only two political outsiders are calling for such a system is an incredibly grim commentary on American politics. I believe that this should be a default policy for the Democrats at bare minimum, and I think we should apply the pressure to make that happen. 

Edit* - I want everyone to know that health care in Canada is a monstrous political football, and governments love to piss around with the funding of said health care. That causes some of the stumbling points as well.   

Double edit* - My wife lives in the United States. That's why I'm here. Spare me the ""why are you in America then"" routine. "

1462106932.0,"In other words, America is a plutocracy (or, if you prefer, an oligarchy). And the only way to challenge this “government by the wealthy” is for the people to rise up and demand a fair and just economy, as they have in the past. This has been Bernie Sanders’ message throughout 2016",
1659468774.0,Jan. 6 text messages wiped from phones of key Trump Pentagon officials,
1452952821.0,How come Bernie needs a plan to pay for his health care proposal but Hillary and none of the other republican candidates have to explain how they'll pay for their endless global wars and mass surveillance?,"> Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that’s why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong **without** either isolating ourselves or **trying to nation-build everywhere there’s a problem.**

>I told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is **political hot air.** Well, **so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It’s not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.** Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that’s the path to ruin. 


-Barack Obama

>CLINTON: Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground. Secondly, **we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.**

-Hillary Clinton

#Clinton supports the same policies that led to the vacuums of power in the Middle East that led to the rise of ISIS and ENDLESS WAR. 

When Hillary Clinton says things like this and wants to focus on taking out Assad and creating a power vacuum in the middle east before taking out ISIS she sounds insane. These aren't liberal or progressive positions. When Clinton says these things she is disagreeing with nearly every democratic president before her. **Is it not clear that she is working for other interests?**

>SANDERS: I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this. Our differences are fairly deep on this issue. We disagreed on the war in Iraq. We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney. I voted against the war.

>But I think -- and I say this with due respect -**that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.**

>**Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS. So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy. But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.**

>**But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS**

**Hillary Clinton also has no comprehensive tax plan and has no way to make her proposals fit into the budget anymore than Sanders does. Clinton's plan is to expand EVERYTHING and make cuts no where.** Sanders at least is realistic about his plans. We can eliminate medicare/medicaid/ss and replace them with universal healthcare and cut Military spending by 50% and still have the strongest military.

https://static.nationalpriorities.org/images/charts/2015-charts/total-desk.svg
 
Clintons ""tax plan"" consists of a few tax rates and proposals to ""close tax loop holes"" but she doesn't state which ones. She doesn't state how her tax plan will directly pay for her health plan or expansion of the military or any of her other proposals. **Hillary Clinton has no math that shows how her plan will fit into the budget.** Literally all she has is a few tax percentages. That's not a plan.

Now let's break down her ""college plan"" which is not a real plan either:

https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/08/10/college-compact-costs/

Where does it say how she'll pay for it? It's all non-speak. It's not a real plan because it's lacking details. Am I expected to go through every page on her site and add up every number?

>Clinton's New College Compact plan costs in the range of $350 billion over 10 years and will be fully paid for by closing tax loopholes and expenditures for the most fortunate. 

What loopholes? What expenditures? There is no REAL information here, and this is exactly how Sanders wants to pay for his plan.  

>We need to make ambitious investments so that cost is no longer a barrier to college education, and the burden of debt does not hold back everyday Americans.

This is meaningless drivel. Is she seriously talking about betting tax money on more ""investments""?

>More than half of the total will go towards grants to states and colleges. 

Half of what??? Her ""investment"" This is scary! Her college plan is based on betting money.

>These grants will ensure that students do not need to take out loans for tuition and that support will also help reduce the burden of living expenses at 4-year public colleges. 

How? she doesn't know what the number will be.

>They will provide free tuition at community colleges, support private non-profit colleges that keep costs low and provide value, and relieve debt for students who commit to national service. 

Again: how? She's not really explaining where the money came from or how much it will be because she doesn't know.

>These new grants will be paired with holding states and colleges accountable for bringing down costs.

Ah, so she will place some of the burden on the states and colleges themselves, another unpredictable variable in Clintons wild ride.

>Around one-third of the funds will go toward relief on interest from student debt.

A third of what???!! This entirely depends on her ""investments"" paying off. Load of shit.

>This includes allowing every American with outstanding public debt to refinance their student loans at today's low interest rates, cutting interest rates to reflect the government’s cost of debt,

Exactly what Sanders wants to do.

>and making it far easier for students to enroll in income-based repayment that limits crushing debt.

Still don't know how, but okay...

>The remaining funds will support innovative new investments to create a higher education system for the 21st Century. That means new funds to expand new models of life-long learning, rewarding college completion and enrollment, and broadening support for student parents.

#Where is the comprehensive plan Hillary? Put up or shut up.

Tonight, President Trump will delivered prime-time Oval Office address to the nation, [to discuss immigration and the ongoing government shutdown.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1082347305699889157) The address aired on all major and cable networks. Directly following President Trump’s remarks was a response from Democratic leadership, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi. This also aired on the same major networks. Today marks the 18th day of a partial government shutdown, which has resulted in the closure of approximately 25% of federal agencies and left over 800,000 federal employees either out of work, or required to work without pay. President Trump has firmly stated that he will not agree to any spending bill that does not include the $5.7 billion in funding for his proposed Mexican border wall. In a statement released earlier today, the White House stated that [Congress Must Do More to Address The Border Crisis](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/congress-must-do-more-to-address-the-border-crisis/).

[A great recap of the shutdown, courtesy of Gabe Fleisher of Wake Up To Politics, can be found here](https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=4946817b18454973fb1cd7ecc&id=3e15225701)

1560262760.0,Elizabeth Warren is proving her doubters wrong,
1461422251.0,Hillary Clinton Was Paid Nearly $1Mil For Speeches Within 30 Days Of Announcing Her Run. Her Staff Was Shopping For A Campaign Office At The Time,"Hillary Clinton is now infamous for taking tens of millions of dollars from private industries actively lobbying the federal government regarding ongoing [concerns,](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ad3c483d59c9463e9a52ef4bc00351e0/firms-paid-clinton-speeches-have-us-govt-interests) and more than a third are government contractors. 

   We have all heard the common refrain to excuse this apparent conflict of interest, which is to claim Clinton was simply a ""private citizen"" who didn't know she was running for President.  In short, the story goes that she didn't officially announce,  she had every right to take any amount of money from any legal entity (it was legal) as long as ""what they offered"" was enough to meet her top of the line speaking fees.  We are told that accepting this money does not constitute a bribe, as there is no evidence it will translate into policy as President. 

  Sec. Clinton gave three of those speeches within 30 days of announcing her run for President.  Clinton was paid $800,000 for her last three speeches before announcing just days later.
  Is it possible that Hillary really didn't know just these few days before announcing her candidacy that she wasn't running? Is it possible to pinpoint the day that this spur of the moment decision came to her?  

  In reality, The Clinton camp had already made moves in preparation for her campaign, including signing a lease on her campaign headquarters just days after her last documented [speech](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2015/08/Hillary%20Clinton%20Speeches%202013-2015_1.jpg).  Based on the reporting at the time, her staff had been searching for real estate in Brooklyn while Clinton was still giving [speeches.](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/hillary-clinton-campaign-headquarters-brooklyn-116649) The idea that she didn't know she was running just isn't plausible.  A presidential campaign of this magnitude is a massive undertaking that requires months (even years) of planning.   

  This issue has been swept under the rug, as if off limits for discussion.  I believe it is something that just can't be ignored.  This will be one of the central points of Republican attacks against Clinton if she takes the nomination.  Ignoring this will only allow it to metastasize.

To recap: On Friday, President Trump issued an executive order banning people from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. We knew what that was: The Muslim ban Trump had campaigned on disguised as a national security measure.

The executive order went into effect immediately, and the ACLU and partner organizations quickly sprang into action. Lawyers at ACLU affiliates across the country camped out at airports to offer assistance to anyone impacted by this order. Protesters showed up at airports across the country, and our communications teams went to the airports to document the protests that sprung up across the country. And early Saturday morning, we sued the Trump administration on behalf of two Iraqi refugees who were detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport. One of those clients, Hameed Khalid Darweesh arrived and was immediately detained. Darweesh worked as interpreter for the U.S. army.

Then at 9pm a federal judge in Brooklyn blocked President Trump’s discriminatory policy from going into effect.

This was the first win in a long battle. We will continue to remain vigilant protecting the civil rights and liberties of anyone impacted by Donald Trump’s policies.

Helping us remain vigilant: We have seen a massive increase in online donations, [$24 million from more than 356,000 donations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/30/the-aclu-says-it-got-24-million-in-donations-this-weekend-six-times-its-yearly-average/?utm_term=.42d2c5806a33) just over the weekend. We’re in a battle of David (us) vs. Goliath (the Trump administration and the weight of the DOJ) but we are ready.

We have a 7-point action plan for how we plan to take on the Trump administration. This includes:

#1. Demand government accountability and transparency:

   * File Freedom of Information Act requests
   * Defend whistleblowers and journalists who rely on them.

#2. Protect the rights of immigrants

   * Mount rapid response to immigration raids
   * File systemic litigation to challenge Fourth Amendment violations and racial profiling in street-level immigration enforcement
   * Develop legal theories to defend sanctuary cities against federal action
   * Represent “Dreamers” when their status comes under attack
   * Bring systemic litigation to challenge excessive and punitive immigration detention
   * Challenge unconstitutional immigration policies that discriminate against Muslims

#3. Defend reproductive rights

   * Oppose efforts to defund Planned Parenthood
   * File litigation to challenge any new federal restrictions on abortion access
   * Challenge laws that permit the use of religion to discriminate by allowing health care providers and social service agencies to turn women away when they seek reproductive health care services or information
   * Challenge abortion restrictions at the state level through litigation and advocacy
   * Challenge existing restrictions on abortion that are more vulnerable to challenge following the Supreme Court’s decision in Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt

#4. Protect First Amendment rights

   * Respond aggressively to threats against Arab, Middle Eastern,            Muslim and South Asian (AMEMSA) communities
   * Expand efforts to defend and inform protestors through know-your-rights materials, provide legal observers at protests and file lawsuits to protect protestors
   * Fight dragnet government surveillance that sweeps up innocent Americans’ information

#5. Defend LGBT rights

   * Fight the rescission of federal LGBT protections
Sue the Department of Defense if it reinstates the ban on open military service by transgender people
   * Oppose religious exemption measures both in state legislatures and Congress that discriminate against LGBT individuals
   * Fight anti-transgender rights bills in Congress and in state legislatures

#6. Defend core civil rights and civil liberties from erosion

   * Identify, investigate, and challenge the worst police departments for Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations
   * Intervene in federal consent decrees with police departments and private employers regarding racial and gender discrimination
   * Litigate against the worst voter suppression measures

#7. Mobilize the American people

   * Deploy our more than a million card-carrying members in direct citizen action, including protests, petitions, and lobbying
   * Raise $100 million for a Constitutional Defense Fund in support of this plan — $47 million of which has already been raised



We can answer a few questions now and will pop in throughout the day to answer more! 

We can’t do any of this without you. Thank you for your support.

1516914249.0,Announcement: ShareBlue has been removed from the whitelist for violation of our media disclosure policies.,"ShareBlue has been removed from the /r/politics whitelist effective immediately. This action applies to all domains or outlets operated directly by the entities `TRUE BLUE MEDIA LLC.` or `SHAREBLUE MEDIA`; no such outlets were found on our whitelist, other than ShareBlue. Accounts affiliated with ShareBlue, including its flaired account /u/sharebluemedia, have been banned from this subreddit.

In the spirit of transparency, we will share as much information as possible. We prohibit doxxing or witch hunting, thus we will not share any personally identifying details. Doxxing and witch hunting are against both our subreddit rules and Reddit's rules, and any attempt or incitement will be met with an immediate ban.
________

# Background

In August 2017, we addressed an account associated with ShareBlue that had been submitting and commenting upon content from that organization without disclosing its affiliation. At that time, we did not have an explicit rule governing disclosure of affiliation with media outlets. We were troubled by the behavior, but after reviewing the available information, we believed that it was poor judgment motivated by enthusiasm, not malice. Therefore, we assumed good faith, and acted accordingly:

On August 28th, we added a rule [requiring disclosure of employment](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_disclosure_of_employment.):

> r/politics expressly forbids users who are employed by a source to post link submissions to that source without broadcasting their affiliation with the source in question. Employees of any r/politics sources should only participate in our sub under their organization name, or via flair identifying them as such which can be provided on request. Users who are discovered to be employed by an organization with a conflict of interest without self identifying will be banned from r/politics. Systematic violations of this policy may result in a domain ban for those who do not broadcast their affiliation.

We also sent a message to the account associated with ShareBlue (identifying information has been removed):

> Effective immediately we are updating our rules to clearly indicate that employees of sources must disclose their relationship with their employer, either by using an appropriate username or by requesting a flair indicating your professional affiliation. We request that you cease submissions of links to Shareblue, or accept a flair [removed identifying information]. Additionally, we request that any other employees or representatives of ShareBlue immediately cease submitting and voting on ShareBlue content, as this would be a violation of our updated rules on disclosure of employment. Identifying flair may be provided upon request. Note that we have in the past taken punitive measures against sources / domains that have attempted to skirt our rules, and that continued disregard for our policies may result in a ban of any associated domains.

When the disclosure rule came into effect, ShareBlue and all known associates appeared to comply. /u/sharebluemedia
 was registered as an official flaired account.

# Recent Developments

Within the past week, we discovered an account that aroused some suspicion. This account posted regarding ShareBlue without disclosing any affiliation with the company; it appeared to be an ordinary user and spoke of the organization in the third person. Communications from this account were in part directed at the moderation team.

Our investigation became significant, relying on personal information and identifying details. We determined conclusively that this was a ShareBlue associated account under the same control as the account we'd messaged in August.

The behavior in question violated our disclosure rule, our prior warning to the account associated with ShareBlue, and [Reddit's self-promotion guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion#wiki_things_that_should_go_without_saying), particularly:

> You should not hide your affiliation to your project or site, or lie about who you are or why you like something... Don't use sockpuppets to promote your content on Reddit.

We have taken these rules seriously since the day they were implemented, and this was a clear violation. A moderator vote to remove ShareBlue from the whitelist passed quickly and unanimously.

# Additional Information

## Why is ShareBlue being removed, but not other sources (such as Breitbart or Think Progress)?

Our removal of ShareBlue from the whitelist is because of specific violations of our disclosure rule, and has nothing to do with suggestions in prior meta threads that it ought to be remove from the whitelist. We did not intend to remove ShareBlue from the whitelist until we discovered the offending account associated with it.

We are aware of no such rule-breaking behavior by other sources at this time. We will continue to investigate credible claims of rules violations by any media outlet, but we will not take action against a source (_such as Breitbart or Think Progress_) merely because it is unpopular among /r/politics subscribers.


## Why wasn't ShareBlue banned back in August?

At that time, we did not have a firm rule requiring disclosure of employment by a media outlet. Our current rule was inspired in part by the behavior in August. We don't take any decision to remove media outlets from the whitelist lightly. In August, our consensus was that we should assume good faith on ShareBlue's part and treat the behavior as a mistake or misunderstanding.

## Can ShareBlue be restored to the whitelist in the future?

We take violation of our rules and policies by media outlets very seriously. As with any outlet that has been removed from the whitelist, we could potentially consider reinstating it in the future. Reinstating these outlets has not traditionally been a high priority for us.

## Are other outlets engaged in this sort of behavior?

We know of no such behavior, but we cannot definitively answer this question one way or the other. We will continue to investigate potential rule-breaking behavior by media outlets, and will take appropriate action if any is discovered. We don't take steps like this lightly - we require evidence of specific rule violations *by the outlet itself* to consider removing an outlet from the whitelist.

## Did your investigation turn up anything else of interest?

Our investigation also examined whether ShareBlue had used other accounts to submit, comment on, or promote its content on /r/politics. We looked at a number of suspicious accounts, but found no evidence of additional accounts controlled by ShareBlue. We found some ""karma farmer"" accounts that submit content from a variety of outlets, including ShareBlue, but we believe they are affiliated with spam operations - accounts that are ""seasoned"" by submitting content likely to be upvoted, then sold or used for commercial spam not related to their submission history. We will continue to work with the Reddit admins to identify and remove spammers.

## Can you assure us that this action was not subject to political bias?

Our team has a diverse set of political views. We strive to set them aside and moderate in a policy-driven, politically neutral way.

The nature of the evidence led to unanimous consent among the team to remove ShareBlue from the whitelist and ban its associated user accounts from /r/politics. Our internal conversation focused entirely on the rule-violating behavior and did not consider ShareBlue's content or political affiliation.

--------

**To media outlets that wish to participate in /r/politics**: we take the requirement to disclose your participation seriously. We welcome you here with open arms and ample opportunities for outreach if you are transparent about your participation in the community. If you choose instead to misdirect our community or participate in an underhanded fashion, your organization will no longer be welcome. 

Please feel free to discuss this action in this thread. We will try to answer as many questions as we can, but we will not reveal or discuss individually identifying information.

1591977683.0,My name is Mike Broihier. I'm running for Senate as a Democrat to beat Mitch McConnell and save our republic. AMA.,"Edit4: Farmer's bedtime - I will answer more tomorrow (Saturday). Keep em coming.

Edit3: Back, let's do this.

Edit2: Another town hall, i will check back again and answer more questions after 8pm ET.

Edit: I've stepped out for a town hall, but I will be back soon. Keep them coming, I will answer more questions in a couple hours.

&#x200B;

Hello, r/politics!

My name is Mike Broihier, and I am running for US Senate here in Kentucky as a Democrat, to retire Mitch McConnell and restore our republic. [Proof](https://twitter.com/MikeForKY/status/1271436849605681156).

I’ve been a Marine, a farmer, a public school teacher, a college professor, a county government official, and spent five years as a reporter and then editor of a local newspaper. With my experiences, we'll put together a winning coalition in a rural state to beat Mitch McConnell once and for all.

We've been endorsed by Andrew Yang, Marianne Williamson, Richard Ojeda, Indivisible Kentucky and [community leaders across the state](https://forwardky.com/broihier-endorsed-by-leaders-across-kentucky-goes-up-on-multiple-television-markets-with-new-ad/).

I have a deep appreciation, understanding, and respect for the struggles that working families and rural communities endure every day in Kentucky – the kind that only comes from living it. That's why I am running a progressive campaign here in Kentucky that focuses on economic and social justice, with a Universal Basic Income as one of my central policy proposals.

We have a plan for [UBI](http://mikeforky.com/ubi-plan), [Medicare For All](https://www.mikeforky.com/m4a), and [Criminal Justice Reform](https://www.mikeforky.com/justice).

[Sign our petition for a Criminal Justice Overhaul Commission here](https://www.change.org/cjoverhaul).

This campaign is headed down to the wire, and Kentuckians are voting now by mail, with minimal in-person voting on June 23rd. If you’re a Kentuckian, [get your ballot here](http://mikeforky.com/ballot).

Ask me ANYTHING!

\----------

My story:

As a Marine Corps officer for over 20 years, I led marines and sailors in wartime and peace. I aided humanitarian efforts and helped separate warring factions during the Somali Civil War, and served as Chief War Planner in the Republic of Korea. My wife Lynn is also a Marine. We retired from the Marine Corps in 2005 and bought Chicken Bristle Farm, a 75-acre farm plot in Lincoln County.

Together we've raised livestock and developed the largest all-natural and sustainable asparagus operation in central Kentucky. I worked as a substitute teacher in the local school district and as a reporter and editor for the Interior Journal, the third oldest newspaper in our Commonwealth.

We started our campaign in July. [Here’s why](https://twitter.com/MikeForKY/status/1270030201666314242).

[Here is an AMA we did in May](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/goprfm/hello_reddit_i_am_mike_broihier_democratic/), and [here’s one from March](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fez6g9/hello_reddit_i_am_mike_broihier_a_farmer_educator/).

Here are some links to my [Campaign Site](http://www.mikeforky.com/) and [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/mikebroihierKY).

\--------------------------------------

To help me answer questions, my staffer Sunil (at u/MikeKYPress) will be here as well. I'll answer as many as I can throughout the day, checking in until at least 8pm ET. Keep them coming."

1413040683.0,Fellow Americans understand this: We're in a class war( corporations versus citizens ) and next month both non-participation or a vote for the G.O.P. is a vote for the American corporate agenda and against the American citizen's agenda.,"**EDIT: emphasized the one clear difference between GOP/DEM that makes one party more corporate/class warriors than the other TAXES)** it was there before, but now it is clearer.

**We're in a class war and it's corporations versus citizens.**

Warren Buffet is not only one of the wealthiest men in the world, he's also his classes biggest traitor who routinely dishes the dirt.  His opinion on the class war
 
was [pretty blunt](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/theres-been-class-warfare-for-the-last-20-years-and-my-class-has-won/2011/03/03/gIQApaFbAL_blog.html): **""There’s been class warfare for the last 20 years, and my class has won""**

If you want a blow by blow of how this war has been and is being waged, read the book [Who Stole the American Dream](http://hedricksmith.com/books/who-stole-the-american-dream/) by Hedrick Smith.  There's a nice summary of the book [here](http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/the-end-of-poverty/inequality-the-choices-we-ve-made).

The results of the class war are terrible for most of us (the 99%):   

* relentless downward pressure on American wages and job security

* shifting costs to the worker and away from the corporation (retirement + health care)

* making average american more easily exploitable by business

* increase of productivity of the worker going mostly to the corporation 

* lowering of taxes on the top earners resulting in a massive accumulation of wealth at the top and a massive increase of the country's deficits crowding out citizen's priorites.

Viewing our votes as for/against a corporate agenda is essential to figuring out how we get our country back.  Most americans don't realize we *need* to be as much on a war footing against our own corporations as we are against terrorists.  It would be analogous to the circumstances we were in before 9/11. Just as terrorist could make/execute plans with impunity, corporations enrich themselves at will at the expense of the country and its citizens and we mount only distracted, token opposition to them doing so.

**Non-participation is a vote for the corporate agenda for America**

To those Americans, who don't plan to vote in a few weeks, please, **please** participate in your civics.  Your country *needs* your engaged, self-interested participation.  Right now the status quo don't need to take into consideration.  To the extent that you don't oppose them and their corporate agenda, they can gain an even greater foothold in our democracy.

Case in point, the last midterm election (2010):  The folk who were animated and showed up to the polls were folks mobilized by all that newly available corporate agenda money via the January Citizen's United ruling.  The lack of engagement and voting by democrats who apparently didn't think their majorities in the congress were worth protecting *is* the reason we now have the ridiculous obstruction we've been living under these last four years.

Here's a secret:  [Cold hard evidence](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/civic-engagement/) that civic engagement helps the average guy get to a better quality of life.  I would maintain that self-interested voting is a lynchpin in that equation as well.  Even if you're engaged, you need to be engaged in voting for what you want and need for those things to be given priority. 

**A vote for the GOP is a vote for the corporate agenda for America**

Both parties are *clearly* in bed with corporate america, so how can I say this?

* **One party refuses to raise taxes to pay down our 17 trillion in debt and blocks every attempt to do so** (This *is* the key difference of the class war that has been/is being waged and illustrates the clearest difference between the democrats and republican parties: where one party supports business and the other prioritizes business wealth *at the expense* of middle class priorities.

It's also the biggest driver of our deficit since Bush/Cheney cut them with no offsets. It was criminally negligent to *choose* to run our country into debt via 500 billion dollar in annual deficits and immoral to do so while we were fighting two wars.

This is that shameful GOP [starve the beast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast) policy that *every American* should vote against the GOP for waging. It is front and center in the class war against the average American and **the GOP own it.** )

* One party supports unions, raising the minimum wage, and wage equality for women the other doesn't

* One party supports the right for women to family plan and the other doesn't

* One party wants immigration reform and the other doesn't

* One party attempted to keep America from the joining the ranks of *every other 1st world nation* in having universal healthcare coverage for it's citizens, the other one enacted and defended that.  Generally speaking, democrats own the safety net.  They have defended it and strengthened it for 100 years.  That having a safety net in America makes you hated by conservatives when it is literally the source of happiness and quality of life for people all over the free world is a mystery to me.

Each of these GOP positions hurts citizens but helps corporations.  My reasoning is that putting dems in right now (how things were in 08) gets us back to sanity.  It also sends the message that obstruction should be a losing not a winning strategy to the GOP.  Their obstruction has [cost this country 1 to 3 million jobs](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2hm1xo/in_37_days_the_house_of_representatives_is_up_for/ckun61o) in our tepid recovery and it needs to be punished.

Am I blindly partisan?  Is this yet another reddit ""democratic circlejerk""?

I've done a lot of reading about these things.  My decisions are formed from what I have read, not blind or indocrinated or ideological or faith driven.  

I'm of an opinion that facts trump any and every kind of ideological position and that doing what works is what we should ALL be aiming for.

Looking around the world at what is working in free democratic societies and adopting those standards; implementing them and then using feedback loops to fix what's not working and improving what is; that *is* my ideology if it can be construed as one.

**What we need from every American of every political persuasion**

To get mad that the corporate media is manipulating the electorate by downplaying every piece of good news and overstating every piece of bad news to discourage your vote, to scare you into making fear motivated decisions and to make you doubtful of the future.  

It's a future we can win if we do what corporations and the 1% never forget to do which is to **vote in our own interests.*  

Vote for your education, healthcare, a safety net to be strong should you need it, the safety of your food, water and environment, protection from unscrupulous businesses, quality shared infrastructure, better wages and opportunities.

The corporations *never* forget to look out for themselves and they've goaded a large portion of the electorate into taking their positions on these things

reduce/privatize education, oppose healthcare, shred safety net, reduce corporate oversight, infrastructure spending yes but no taxes to pay for it, lower wages by outsourcing, hiring the undocumented, opposing unions, wage equality, etc...

In each case they cut cost on individual concerns and pocket the savings.

We've become this pro-business/no citizen agenda society even to the detriment of the quality of life for our own families."

But what does she really mean by this? 

When we look at how she gets her money there are no real clear answers. In fact we have to dig to find anything, but we find that Hillary Clinton is no stranger to the Corporate interest groups and lobbyist. 

We know that she receives donations from [Oil Companies / Oil Company Lobbyist ]( http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/oil-companies-donated-clinton-foundation-while-lobbying-state-department-2348832) 

[It's not a Lie, Fossil Fuel Investors Are Pumping Millions of Dollars Into Hillary Clinton's Campaign](https://news.vice.com/article/fossil-fuel-investors-are-pumping-millions-of-dollars-into-hillary-clintons-campaign)

We also know that Hillary’s Clinton Foundation received money from [Atomic Energy companies as well](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-gained-us-uranium-assets). Uranium One in three separate transactions after being purchased by a Russian atomic-energy agency, Rosatom from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons. Soon after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.

We now know that [Egyptian Companies and Government Entities](http://www.ibtimes.com/hillary-clintons-state-department-increased-chemical-arms-sales-middle-east-countries-1949653)   gave money to the Clinton Foundation while Her State Department cleared Egypt to continue purchasing arms the U.S. government classified as toxicological agents, a broad designation that included chemical and biological weapons. Once in 2010, Mubarak government paid Bill Clinton a $250,000 speaking, less than 4 months before the Egyptian revolution began , And again  in 2012, a firm with an ownership stake in the company that manufactured the tear gas reportedly used by Egyptian security forces against the protesters paid $100,000 to $250,000 for another Bill Clinton speech.

Clinton’s massive campaign machine is built and fueled from the very thing — super PACs, secret cash, unlimited contributions — she says she’ll attack once she wins the White House.
How is it that Clinton still claims that she is “THE MOST TRANSPARENT CANDIDATE IN MODERN TIMES” when her Foundation [Failed to Disclose 1,100 Foreign Donations](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-29/clinton-foundation-failed-to-disclose-1-100-foreign-donations)  . And this is on top of Clinton's Failure once again to disclose more than $26,000,000  in speaking fees [""from foreign governments and corporations"" ]( http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/21/politics/clinton-foundation-speech-income/index.html)  Because you know….“That’s what they offered”.

In the years before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, the [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia contributed at least $10,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation](http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-foundation-donors-got-weapons-deals-hillary-clintons-state-department-1934187) Just two months before a deal with Boeing to make warplanes was finalized with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, [Boeing donated $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/boeing-gave-to-clinton-causes-after-hillary-steered-its-russian-contract/article/2563994)

The Hillary Clinton campaign and Foundation have been raking in cash from Banks that have [admitted Wrongdoing](http://www.ibtimes.com/clintons-foundation-raked-cash-banks-admitted-wrongdoing-2010404). So once again we see here that Hillary does not mind muddying the waters, Saying that she will be hard on these banking institutions while taking more money from these banking institutions that any normal person could ever hope to make in a lifetime. 

Then there is that added issue of the [Panama Papers](https://panamapapers.icij.org/), and  the issue of Clintons Foundation and Campaign connection to it and the vast array of institutions caught in this scandal. In lobbying for the Panama-United States Trade Promotion Agreement, Clinton paved the way for major banks and corporations, most notably the Deutsche Bank, to skirt national laws and regulations.  Once she resigned as the Secretary of State, the Deutsche Bank paid her $485,000 for a speech. While criminality can’t yet be definitively established, this may change when the “Süddeutsche Zeitung” publishes its comprehensive list at the end of the month. In addition to the aforementioned connection, Clinton’s name has already surfaced in connection to a billionaire and a Russian-controlled bank named in the files. Which I imagine is a connection to the Podesta Group, a lobbying firm co-founded by Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother, Tony Podesta, a major Clinton bundler. According to the Washington Free Beacon, which first reported the connection, Sberbank registered with the Podesta Group last month to lobby on issues related to economic sanctions against Russia and on stock and bond trading for its U.S. clients.

**EDIT 2:** If you want to see that Clinton is willing to win no matter what the cost [Listen to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2f13f2awK4), or how about when her campaign [disseminated pictures of Obama](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/26/barackobama.uselections2008) when they were running against each 8 years ago.

**EDIT 4:** for those who keep telling me that Hillary has always supported the LGTB crowd. 

We can blame Bill Clinton for the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a law which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages. Clinton defended her husband’s Sept. 21, 1996 signing of the bill.

This is where Hillary Clinton said that [she does not support Gay Marriage / Civil Unions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZkK2_6H9MM)

This is where Hillary Clinton Said that [she believes that Marriage is only between a man and a woman in 2004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I1-r1YgK9I)

Senator Sanders has been a longtime supporter of LGBT rights. In 1983, during his first term as Mayor of Burlington, Sen. Sanders supported the city’s first ever Pride Parade. He later signed a city ordinance banning housing discrimination.

When he served in the House of Representatives, then-Congressman Sanders voted against “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” in 1993 and the so-called “Defense of Marriage Act” in 1996. Sen. Sanders hailed the landmark Supreme Court decisions in 2013 and 2015 which struck down DOMA and recognized same-sex marriage is a right in all 50 states, calling the decisions a “victory for same-sex couples across our country as well as all those seeking to live in a nation where every citizen is afforded equal rights.”

Once again Bernie Sanders is on the right side of History. "

While you don't know me yet, you probably know of my opponent all too well. I could write pages about her shortcomings, but I'll leave it with this: She's an insurrection supporter, a Trump loyalist to the core, and generally makes the US Congress, Georgia, and government in general look unintelligent and often unintelligible..


I'm going to change all of that. I'm running on a platform of candor - because politicians have a well-earned reputation for lying, because corporate money plays too big of an *un-elected* role, because so many lawmakers (regardless of party) value their own bank account and lavish vacations over the people who elected them.  I believe that ""Thoughts and Prayers"" have done all the good that they will for the gun obsession in this country, it's time for something new. I believe that healthcare is a basic human right, and that there's no reason medical debt *should even be* a cause of bankruptcy, let alone the **primary** cause.


I'm running for Congress because - for my entire life - policy has been written by, with, and for people born before 1960. I will continue to legislate with them in mind, ***however*** I will not ignore or forget Generations X, Y, and Z - Who have FAR different ideals than their elder counterparts, in general. The internet has made the world both incredibly large (in terms of what we can see across the globe) and incredibly small (in terms of what we have access to, in our pocket!). Governing in the digital era is going to take someone who understands that the internet is **not** a series of tubes, and that social media companies may police their terms of service as they see fit, and it's not a first amendment issue. We need someone who understands that the nation's phone lines are no longer equipped to handle the data we consume, either for business or leisure - that we do have a growing need for access to broadband in homes - whether that be fiber, wireless, or satellite based - and it needs to be competitively priced.


I'm running for Congress because the hate - from every direction - needs to stop, and I know that we need to remove the villains who keep pumping venom into the national conversations, whenever they're included. I'm running for Congress because I'm angry that the country that I love (while acknowledging that she **absolutely** has faults) is so close to falling - not from without, but from within. I'm running for Congress because America is tired of Trump's version of ""winning"".
